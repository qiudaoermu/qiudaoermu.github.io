### The difference 
When us learning a new language, i find most people 's ablity in  reading and listing has little difference , because it's passtive . Everyone listen audio news,watch movies ,listening broadcast and read words online , listen  others talking so on.
we can understand what other want to express not vary hardly.
But not everybody write or speak frequently daily  .
Even someone don't write words , because it's active .
we need organize our logic ,words, grammar .
We dont have much chances to speak or write positively.
### The connection
Writing and speaking is based on reading and listening .If we dont hear something ,we can't utilize them .
when we practice Writing and speaking, it will check what we receive by feedback .https://www.instagram.com/reels/DBZIGXnN1Rm/
